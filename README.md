Adaptive Power Line Interference Canceller
=================================

The source code of a proposed algorithm for removal of power line interference from neural signals.
The provided MATLAB .m file is the implementation of the proposed algorithm in 
Mohammad Reza Keshtkaran and Zhi Yang, "Power Line Interference Cancellation in Neural Recording", Submitted to Journal of Neural Engineering, 8/2013.

You need MATLAB Software to run the program. 

For User Guide, please refer to "removePLI.m" or type "help removePLI" in the MATLAB command prompt.
The MATLAB script "test_removePLI.m" runs the algorithm on sample intracortical, ECoG, EEG and ECG signals.

You can download the full package by clicking "Download Zip".

## Usage

```
  x, input (contaminated) signal
  s, output (clean) signal
  fs, sample rate in Hz
  M, number of harmonics to remove
  B, contains three elements [B0,Binf,Bst]: 
	- B0, Initial notch bandwidth of the frequency estimator
	- Binf, Asymptotic notch bandwidth of the frequency estimator
	- Bst, Rate of convergence to 95% of the asymptotic bandwidth Binf
  P, contains three elements [P0,Pinf,Pst]: 
	- P0, Initial settling time of the frequency estimator
	- Pinf, Asymptotic settling time of the frequency estimator
	- Pst, Rate of convergence to 95% of the asymptotic settling time
  W, Settling time of the amplitude and phase estimator
  f_ac, Optional argument, the nominal AC frequency if known (50 Hz or 60 HZ)
```
```
>> s = removePLI(x, fs, M, B, P, W, f_ac)
```
```
  EXAMPLE:
		fs = 500;
		n = 120*fs; %2-min sequence	
		t = 2*pi*(1:n)/fs;
		fline = 60 + randn; %ramdom interference frequency
		s = filter(1,[1,-0.99],100*randn(1,n)); %1/f PSD
		p = 80*sin(fline*t+randn) + 50*sin(2*fline*t+randn)...
		  + 20*sin(3*fline*t+randn); % interference	
		x = s + p;
		sbar = removePLI(x, fs, 3, [100,0.01,4], [0.1,2,5], 3);
		pwelch(s,[],[],[],fs); title('PSD of the original signal')
		figure; pwelch(x(fs:end),[],[],[],fs); 
		title('PSD of the contaminated signal');
		figure; pwelch(sbar(fs:end),[],[],[],fs); 
		title('PSD after interference cancellation');
